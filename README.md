[【中文教程】](https://github.com/downclash/clash)

A comprehensive collection of the latest Clash web and client download links for 2026. This guide covers popular branches like Clash Verge Rev, Mihomo Party, and Clash Mi. It supports Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux, providing official installation package backups and detailed configuration tutorials.

## What is Clash? Why Mihomo Kernel is Recommended in 2026?

**Clash** is a multi-platform rule-based proxy tool developed in Go, supporting intelligent traffic splitting, high-speed proxying, and various encryption protocols (e.g., V2Ray, Trojan, Shadowsocks).

Since the original Clash Core project is no longer maintained, the mainstream choice in 2026 has shifted to the **Mihomo (formerly Clash Meta)** kernel. This kernel supports more private protocols (like Hysteria2, Reality) and offers better performance with enhanced conversion efficiency. It is highly recommended to download GUI clients that support this kernel.
